      <description>Background In this exercise you are asked to design a process using BPMN and DMN. The scenario description can be found in the next section. To model it use the Camunda 8 Web Modeler https://modeler.cloud.camunda.io/.
Task: Model the following process. We are designing a process to manage the quarantine of persons infected with HZV - the &amp;ldquo;Hypothetical Zombie Virus&amp;rdquo;. Statistically, 5% of people who are infected with the Zombie Virus turn into actual undead Zombies, with an insatiable craving to eat human brains.</description>

      <description>Background After having modelled and aligned on our process diagram we are now going to discover the capabilities of Camunda 8.
Task: Try out Camunda 8 features Camunda Platform 8 is powered by Zeebe, a new class of BPMN workflow engine that delivers true horizontal scalability and enables high-performance use cases that were once beyond the realm of workflow automation.
The Camunda 8 Console https://console.cloud.camunda.io/ acts as an entry point to Camunda Platform 8.</description>

      <description>Background We have created a process in our Camunda Platform 8 environment during exercise 1 already. In this section we want to deploy this process after having added Camunda Forms to a User Task.
Task: Add User Tasks and a Form to the User Tasks In the animated image below - showing a single user task - you can see how to change the type of activity. After having done so we can change some User Task specific properties such as the assignee.</description>

      <description>Background Now, we are ready to automate the process we have created and aligned on. Below you can find a representation of that process.
Task: Automate the process To automate this process three steps need to be automated:
Notify the person to quarantine Generate certificate of recovery Send certificate of recovery Automation in Camunda Platform is implemented using the external worker pattern. &amp;ldquo;Glue code&amp;rdquo; is code that you write in a worker to glue the automation to external services.</description>

      <description>Background Having automated the process and tried it out multiple times, we are ready to analyse the process in Optimize.
Task: Use Optimize to analyze the process This tool helps you to create business-friendly reports and dashboards as well as alerts that help you to identify process bottlenecks and improve the overall performance of your end-to-end process.
To get started, please launch the Optimize application from your Cluster and create a new collection for our reports and dashboards.</description>
